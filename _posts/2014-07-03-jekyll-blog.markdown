After a while thinking about migrating my blog to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I finally made it.

It didn't happen the way I wanted tho. My old website, build with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org), was partially lost due an attack the VPS service suffered a couple of weeks ago. I would be able to restore the Wordpress version, but decided to move forward to Jekyll.

So far it's been funny. I started pointing my domain to GitHub few days ago, and today I set up Jekyll to serve as my blogging platform. The proccess was really simple and easy.

If you are looking for a Jekyll blog example, fell free to check and fork my [Github repository](http://github.com/luizpedone/luizpedone.github.io).
