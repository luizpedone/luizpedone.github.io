If you use [PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) in more than one computer, you may like to set up the same settings on every place you work. To do that, PHPStorm provides an export configuration option. It builds a .jar file that you can load on any other computer you need.

To generate your configuration export file, click in  **File**, then in **Export Settings**. Select the settings you'd like to have on all your workplaces and export it.

On another machine, just load the .jar settings file using **File** > **Import Settings**.

Pretty easy, eh?
