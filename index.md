<p>Hi! My name is Luiz Felipe Pedone. I'm a web developer at <a href="http://www.meliuz.com.br/">Meliuz</a> living in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte">Belo Horizonte</a>, Brazil.</p>
<p>I started coding in 2010. Since then, I've been using PHP for most of the time, but I've spent some time coding in Java, Python and Ruby as well.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I'm a big <a href="http://www.nhl.com/">ice hockey</a> and <a href="http://penguins.nhl.com">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> fan. I'm also a big football fan, as pretty much any Brazilian. Because of these sports, I've kept blogs for some decent time [<a href="http://penguinsreport.blogspot.com.br/">Pens Report</a> | <a href="http://camisa10.blogspot.com.br/">Camisa 10</a>].</p>
<p>If you would like to contact me, please ping me at some of the social mediums bellow.</p>
