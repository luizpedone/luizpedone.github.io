Hi! My name is Luiz Felipe Pedone. I'm a web developer at [Meliuz](http://www.meliuz.com.br/ "Cupom de Desconto - Meliuz"), living in [Belo Horizonte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte), Brazil.

I started coding in 2010. Since then, I've been using PHP for most of the time, but I've spent some time coding in Java, Python and Ruby as well.

On a personal level, I'm a big [ice hockey](http://www.nhl.com/) and [Pittsburgh Penguins](http://penguins.nhl.com/) fan. I'm also a big football fan, as pretty much every Brazilian is. Because of these sports, I've kept blogs for some decent time [[Pens Report](http://penguinsreport.blogspot.com.br/) & [Camisa 10](http://camisa10.blogspot.com.br/)].

If you would like to contact me, please ping me at one of the social media methods below.
